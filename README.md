# Pokémon Battle Simulator

A web-based Pokémon battle simulator that allows users to select Pokémon and initiate a battle based on their stats, moves, and type effectiveness. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the **PokéAPI** for fetching Pokémon data.

## Features

- **Pokémon Selection**: Select two Pokémon from a pre-defined list to engage in a battle.
- **Battle Simulation**: Battle between two selected Pokémon, using their stats (attack, defense, speed), moves, and type effectiveness to determine the winner.
- **Pokémon Details**: View detailed stats, moves, abilities, and locations for each Pokémon in a pop-up modal.
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, Pokémon cry playback, and dynamic battle results.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **PokéAPI**: For retrieving Pokémon data and battle stats.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the live version.

## How It Works

1. **Pokémon Data Fetching**: The app fetches a predefined list of Pokémon using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
2. **Pokémon Selection**: Users can select up to two Pokémon cards, which are highlighted upon selection.
3. **Battle Logic**: Once two Pokémon are selected, a battle is simulated using their base stats (Attack, Defense, Speed), random moves, and type effectiveness.
4. **Battle Outcome**: The app calculates damage based on move power, type effectiveness, and stats to determine the winner.
5. **Pokémon Details**: Users can click on a Pokémon card to view more information, including abilities, moves, height, weight, and location encounters.
